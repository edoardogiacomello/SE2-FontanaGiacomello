\section{Overall description}
This section will cover the overall description of the product. In particular it will put this product into the perspective of other products or systems. 
\subsection{Product Perspective}
The \productname system will partially replace any former traditional system that is based on phone calls with a new interactive system based on mobile and web interfaces. \newline
The decision of completely dismissing the former phone call system in favor to the new one will be left to the customer, since \productname requires the passengers to access a web interface or a mobile application, which is still generally not accessible by some users.
\newline
The project will therefore consists in releasing a web application and a mobile app which are not integrated with any other existing taxi management service.
The system is created to improve the possibility to connect with the taxi service for requesting a taxi, that is based on phone calls.
With this system, the taxi service can provide a fast and innovative system that allow to manage the user request rapidly, without any loss of time.
Both the mobile application and the web interface are connected to the central system and allow the user to know in real time the waiting time, the taxi occupation and their location, and allows to make a taxi request receiving a rapid response.
The application will furthermore provide a programmatic interface for the integration with future systems and extensions.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Application for passengers} \newline
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It has to provide a \textbf{login page} that allows users to be recognized by the system, along with a registration form that let the user to sign up to the service and a link for resetting the user password.
		In the home page after the login, it is possible to see the map of the zone in which the user is and the taxis that are nearby, along with a menu for accessing the other functionalities. If a taxi is available, the user can request a ride by selecting the button "Call Now". If a taxi is not available, a text message will display the estimated waiting time and the button will let the user to queue. When the user select the request button, a \textbf{confirmation dialog} will ask the user to insert the precise meeting location and, in the case the user is making a reservation, the meeting time.
		After the user has made a taxi request, the system will show directly in the home page the  estimated waiting time for that request. In the case he has made a reservation, the home page is steal usable for making a request, while clicking on \textbf{"your reservation"} a page will display the current reservation status.
		\item \textbf{Passenger menu}
		\begin{description}
			\item[Home] Shows the home page from which is possible to make a new request or check the arrival time and the taxi code of the pending request.
			\item[Your Reservation] Shows the list of pending reservations along with the status or estimated arrival time/taxi code.

		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_TaxiInterface} and Administration}: The system should provide a web interface for system administrators, in which they can manage the taxi drivers and the passenger profiles
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_Confirmation}} The system sends a remainder email or push notification to the user who reserved a taxi 2 hour before the meeting time, just after that it has assigned a taxi to that request.
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_FairManagement}}: The system should manage exceptional situations such the availability of taxis or accidents/vehicle failures.
		\item \textit{\textbf{Not provided functionality}}: The system will not manage the payment for the taxi, which will occour directly to the taxi driver via cash or credit card and it will be managed separately by the transportation company
		
	\end{enumerate}
\subsection{User charateristics}
	There are 4 types of system users: \newline
	\begin{description}
		\item[passenger] Who access the system for requesting a transportation. For this purpose, the user must have an internet connection on his smartphone or computer. In the case he's using a smartphone, the user can have the \productname application installed or using the web interface. For using the web interface the user must have a compatible browser.
		\item[Taxi Driver] Who provide the transportation to the passengers. The user interacts with the system for receiving transportation tasks. The user will be provided a compatible device in advance, and must be in possess of his login credentials, which are generated by the system and managed by system administrators. 
		\item[System Administrator] Who manages the transportation service. The system administrator is in charge to give support to taxi drivers and passengers, in particular to create and supervise taxi drivers' accounts. It's the only figure that have access to the system logs and taxi managements.
		\item[System Developers] Who is in charge to further extends the system. System developers will make use of this document and the Design document for planning the addition of new functionalities.
	\end{description}
\subsection{Constraints}
\subsubsection{Regulatory Policies}
The system shall comply with the following regulatory policies:
\begin{itemize}
	\item CODICE IN MATERIA DI PROTEZIONE DEI DATI PERSONALI "Decreto legislativo 30 giugno 2003, n. 196"
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Reliability Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In case of system faliure, the system must be recoverable from a previous backup
		
		\item The system infrastructure (data centers, servers, network infrastructures, etc) must be sized accordingly to the expected user base size. 
		
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Criticality of the application}
The main criticalities of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The compliance of the interface according to the usability metrics explained in section 3.
	\item The fair management of taxis. In particular the system must not waste resources such as not reallocating unemployed taxi when necessary and must allocate requests according to well defined precedence rules.
\end{itemize}
A failure in one or more of this criticalities will lead to the loss of clients.


\subsubsection{Safety and Security Consideration}
\productname should comply to the serurity statements listed above: \newline
\begin{itemize}
	\item Only logged users can request a taxi ride. This is for preventing any malicious behaviour in which unknown users can make taxi request without making use of the transportation service.
	\item At the time of registration, a user must read and accept any privacy policy about the user data management
	\item The system must undertake to not divulge the user data to third parties, in addition the user data will be used only for the supply of the service
	\item For the reason stated before, the passenger must supply at least:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Name
			\item Surname
			\item e-mail address
			\item Phone number or Tax Code
			\item Password
		\end{itemize}
		\item While the taxi drivers must supply at least:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Taxi Code
			\item e-mail address
			\item Phone number or Tax Code
			\item Password
		\end{itemize}
	\item The system should therefore warn the user about the regulation policy about false impersonation.
	\item The system will hash the user password before storing it into the database, preventing unauthorized access in the case of data leak.
	\item The system will ask the user the email address or the phone number in order to reset his password. The new password will be sent on the user e-mail address.
	\item In the case of taxi drivers, the password is generated by the system and it's updated periodically. The taxi drivers will receive their new password by email.
	\item Every request must be associated to the user identity and kept in a log for security reasons and kept available for  judicial authorities.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependancies}
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \label{itm: Assumption_Zones} The city is already divided in Taxi Zones of approximately 2x2 km each. 
		\item \label{itm: Assumption_MobileProvisioning} Taxis or Taxi Drivers are assumed to be in possession of a mobile device that  1) have GPS functionalities and 2) is capable of establishing an internet connection with the facility in which the system is hosted. In the case one of these assumption does not hold, the Taxi driver must contact his referent in order to solve the issue.
		\item \label{itm: Assumption_NumberOfTaxis} The number of taxi in service are at least equal to the number of zones.
		\textbf{Rationale}: In this way, in the case that a zone queue is empty, an incoming request is guaranteed to be served by at least one taxi in an estimable time by propagating the request to adjacent zone and forwarding the request to the nearest first taxi that is available.
		\item \label{itm: Assumption_FormerSystems} The service is currently running a traditional system based on phone calls	
		\item \label{itm: Assumption_Payment} The payment will occur directly to the taxi driver by cash or credit card and it will be managed by the transportation company
		\item \label{itm: Assumption_Destination} The taxi drivers should not know in advance what the ride destination will be. The passenger informs directly the taxi driver about the desired arrival location.
		\item \label{itm: Assumption_OneReservation} The taxi Drivers are supposed to accept one request or reservation at a time.
		\item \label{itm: Assumption_LengthTime} The maximum time length of a ride is 1 hour and 45 minutes.
		
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Specific Requirements}
\subsection{External Interfaces} %This should be a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from complement the interface descriptions in 5.2 and should not repeat informati



\subsection{Functions} %Functional requirements should deÞne the fundamental actions that must take place in the software in accepting and processing the inputs and in processing and generating the outputs.
This section will list specific functional requirements needed in order to accepting and processing inputs and processing and generating the outputs.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_FairManagement}}: The mobile application for Taxi Drivers shall transmit the taxi GPS location to the system every 30 seconds, in order to keep the taxi queues updated.
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_FairManagement}}: When a taxi becomes available, the system shall store the taxi identifier in the queue of the corresponding zone
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_FairManagement}}: When a request arrives from a certain zone and there is at least one available taxi in that zone, the system shall forward it to the first taxi queuing in that zone.
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_FairManagement}}: Upon an incoming request, If the Taxi Drivers confirms  the system shall inform the passenger, if he doesn’t confirm then the system will forward the request to the next driver in queue and move the taxi driver which refused in the last position in the queue.
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_Confirmation}}: The passenger will be informed of any unexpected event by email if he made the request via the web interface and via email and push notification if he’s using the mobile application. 
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_Confirmation}}: In any case, the passenger can check the request details and information by accessing the web or mobile interface
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_FairManagement}}: If the taxi driver who accepted a request is unable to reach the passenger in a reasonable amount of time (i.e. due to an accident or a vehicle failure) then the taxi driver should be able to release its request. The request is forwarded to the first available taxi and the passenger will receive an update about the new taxi code and the new estimated waiting time.
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_Reservation}}: The reservation request is accepted only if it is made at least two hours before the ride. An earlier reservation should be made impossible to select from the GUI and double checked in the backend.
		\item \textit{Relative to goals \linkitm{itm:Goal_FairManagement} and \linkitm{itm:Goal_Reservation}}:For guaranteeing the precedence of reservation over real-time requests, a reservation is forwarded to a taxi 2 hours before the meeting time: in this way the taxi will result not available for eventual real-time requests (which has a maximum time length, as stated in the assumption \linkitm{itm:Assumption_LengthTime}) that occur in the meanwhile and the request will be forwarded to the next taxi. The taxi is supposed to be at the meeting point at least 10 minutes before the meeting time.
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_FairManagement}}: Along with the taxi queue, there will be a Request Queue, with a FIFO policy. In this way, the first passenger who makes a real-time request is the first that is served by the first available taxi. 
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_PassengerInterface}}: The system should provide passengers a "password reset" service.
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_PassengerInterface}}: The system should let the user cancel a previous reservation he made until 2 hours before the meeting time.
		\item \textit{Relative to goal \linkitm{itm:Goal_Confirmation}}: The system will send notification to a user as soon as the request has been accepted by a taxi driver
		\item The GPS localization of the passenger is used merely for providing a better GUI experience (i.e. showing the right portion of the map) and it is an optional requirement for the passenger. The actual localization occurs by the information that the user provides by inserting the meeting location while making a request.
